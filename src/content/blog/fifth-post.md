## Data preparation
Once you have a clear idea of the design, prepare your data to ensure it’s clean, accurate and well structured. Use Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform your datasets. Good data preparation is essential for effective and accurate visualizations. Here are a few steps to follow:  
**- Data cleansing:** Make sure your data is free of duplicates, missing values and errors. Power Query enables you to do this efficiently.

**- Create Measures, Tables and Calculated Columns:** Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create customized measures. Metrics let you calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important statistics dynamically. For example: Create Calculated Columns: If required, add calculated columns to enrich your data with new, derived information.

## Template Creation
Creating the template can be the most time-consuming phase of creating an interactive dashboard with Power BI, because every detail counts. The selection of colors, fonts and layouts must be meticulous to ensure a clear and intuitive presentation of information. The personalization of visuals and the integration of interactive functions require particular attention in order to maximize the impact and comprehension of data.      
#### Design Software
You can create design templates using a number of different tools, depending on your specific needs and preferences. The most commonly used are listed below:  
**- PowerPoint:** ideal for structured presentations and easy-to-adapt designs.  
**- Figma:** Perfect for collaborative designs and interactive prototypes.  
**- Photoshop:** Excellent for detailed, customized graphic designs.  
#### Design Resource Tools
**- Color picker:** tools like Coolors or Adobe Color can help you choose harmonious color palettes.  
**- Icon sites:** resources such as Flaticon and Noun Project offer a vast collection of free and premium icons to embellish your visuals.  
**- Typography:** Use sites such as Google Fonts to select the right fonts for your design.

#### Template creation using PowerPoint
Make sure your templates are consistent with your corporate identity and allow for clear presentation of information. Well-designed templates facilitate integration and recurring use in your various reports. If, like me, you use Microsoft PowerPoint, it’s advisable to export your templates in SVG format, because of its scalability.

## Template Integration into Power BI reports
Once you’ve finished designing your template with the software of your choice, you export it for integration into your Power BI report. Customizing the background of your pages makes your reports more attractive and professional, improving the readability and aesthetics of your data. This section guides you through the process of integrating a canvas background into Power BI Desktop. The steps are as follows:

1. Open Power BI Desktop and load your report.  
2. Select the “Format” tab in the ribbon at the top of the screen.

3. Click on the “Page Background” icon. A “Wallpaper” map appears in the right-hand panel.   
4. Choose a color or image for the background. You can select a color from the “Color” drop-down menu, or click on “Add file” to choose an image.![Article](/art57.webp)  
5. Adjust the transparency of your background using the “Transparency” slider to keep the visuals legible.![Article](/art58.webp)  
6. Apply the background to all pages of your report, or only to a specific page as required.
#### Creation of Visuals
Once the background has been integrated, it’s time to add the visuals to your dashboard to bring your data to life:  
1. Choose the appropriate visualizations to represent your data clearly and intuitively. Use bar charts, pie charts, maps and other visualizations available in Power BI.  
2. Drag and Drop visualizations onto your canvas, keeping the layout clean and logical.  
3. Add segments and filters to enable interactivity. For example, a date segment can allow users to filter data by specific time periods.  
4. Use custom visuals available on the Microsoft AppSource to add variety and depth to your dashboard.  
5. Ensure visual consistency by using the themes and custom colors you’ve defined in your templates.![Article](/art59.webp)
#### Adding Interactive Elements
To further enhance the interactivity of your dashboard, add elements such as buttons, bookmarks and text boxes. These elements can guide users and make the experience more intuitive:  
**1. Buttons:** Add buttons to navigate between report pages or to trigger specific actions. You can customize buttons with icons and colors.  
**2. Bookmarks:** Use bookmarks to capture the current state of a page and return to it easily. They are useful for creating specific views or customized reports.  
**3. Text boxes:** Integrate text boxes to add titles, descriptions or additional explanations to your visuals. This helps contextualize data and improve comprehension.  
**4. Custom tooltips:** Create custom tooltips to provide additional contextual information when users hover over a visual.
