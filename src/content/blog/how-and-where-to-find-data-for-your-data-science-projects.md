Whether you’re a beginner or an expert in data science, at some point you’ll need to work with data for a workshop, to enhance your CV or simply to carry out projects that you can present to the general public without fear of divulging confidential information about any organization. Since this isn’t possible with data from the company you work for (for professionals) or because you’re not working yet, this article presents 8 websites where you can download data quickly and free of charge for your data science experiments, depending on your type of project.

Before exploring these sites, it’s important to understand that data sources fall into two categories: private and public. In addition, there are communities and forums that also provide valuable datasets. For ease of organization, we’re going to classify these sites according to three types of data science projects: data processing, data visualization and machine learning/deep learning.

### Data sources
In data science, access to quality data is essential for performing analyses, creating predictive models and visualizing results. These sources enable you to find reliable datasets for your projects, whether for exploratory analysis, predictive modeling or data visualization using languages such as R or Python, or BI (Business Intelligence) tools such as Tableau or Power BI. The following sections present the different data sources available to data scientists, classified into three main categories: public sources, private sources and communities/forums.

**1. Public data sources:** These come from government-run organizations and institutions. They are generally open and accessible to all, as they are financed by public funds. This data is often shared to promote transparency, innovation and research. Here are just a few examples: Data.gov, UCI Machine Learning Repository, World Bank Open Data…

**2. Private data sources:** These come from companies and organizations run by individuals or private for-profit groups. These data may be accessible free of charge, or subject to subscription or payment. It is often used for commercial or academic analysis, and can offer valuable insights into a variety of industries. For example: Google Dataset Search, AWS Dataset Search : Google Dataset Search, AWS Public Datasets…

**3. Communities and forums:**   These are platforms where individuals share, discuss and collaborate around their common interests. In the context of data science, these online spaces can be incredibly rich sources of datasets, practical advice and inspiration for your projects. Here are just a few examples: Reddit, GitHub, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle…

Data scientists have many sources of data to enrich their projects and research. Public data offers transparency and open access, private data provides valuable information for specific and commercial analyses, and communities/forums provide practical advice and datasets shared by other enthusiasts. By using these different sources, data scientists can obtain the best data for their projects.

### Project Types
Rather than waste time searching for datasets without knowing if they are suitable for your project, which can be both frustrating and exciting, this section will guide you to the most appropriate sites. Quality datasets are available online, tailored to your specific needs.
Whether you want to improve your data processing or visualization portfolio, or test machine learning algorithms, you’ll find the resources you need here. So let’s take a look at the 3 types of data science projects: cleansing, visualization and (deep) machine learning, to identify the right places to find the ideal dataset.

##### Data processing projects
A good dataset for data processing must meet a number of specific criteria:
- A good dataset for cleansing should contain typical errors, such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats and typographical errors, enabling various cleansing techniques to be put into practice.
- It should include different types of data (numerical, categorical, textual, etc.) to enable different aspects of cleaning to be addressed.
- The dataset should be large enough to provide a realistic challenge, but not too large to remain manageable during the cleaning process.
- It is essential that the dataset is accompanied by clear documentation and metadata, explaining the columns, data types and expected values. This makes it easy to understand data quality expectations.

#### Data visualization projects
A good dataset for data visualization should be :
- Well-organized, nuanced and interesting enough to create relevant diagrams.
- It should not contain too many rows or columns for ease of use.
- In addition, it’s ideal if each column is well explained to ensure accurate visualization.
- Finally, it’s best to choose datasets from news or data journalism sites, as they often publish data that has already been cleaned and organized.

#### Machine learning and Deep learning projects
A good dataset for machine learning (or deep learning) must meet a number of criteria, including the following:
- Data must be accurately labeled to enable supervised learning algorithms to train properly. The labels help define the expected results or classifications.
- To train deep learning models, a large volume of data is essential. The larger the dataset, the better the model’s ability to generalize from the training data.
- The dataset should contain a variety of features and classes to avoid bias and improve model robustness. Data diversity makes the model more flexible and efficient.
- Data must be clean and relevant. Although models can tolerate certain errors, the overall quality of the data strongly influences model performance.
- Datasets should be in formats that can be easily exploited by machine learning and deep learning libraries, such as CSV, JSON, or image formats for computer vision projects.

Categorizing your data science projects into processing, visualization and machine learning simplifies the search for appropriate datasets. As each type of project has specific needs, this approach helps you to quickly identify the most appropriate resources. As a result, you save time and improve the efficiency of your projects, ensuring that you always have the most relevant data.
